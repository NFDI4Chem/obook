In this lesson, we will discuss:

- Core concepts, from characteristics and biological attributes to phenotypic abnormalities
- Different types of phenotype data capture in practice
- An overview on how the uPheno framework supports integrating all kinds of phenotype data into a computational framework
- A brief outlook and how computational phenotypes can be exploited for analysis

## Overview

Phenotyping is, in essence, the process of recording the observable characteristics, or phenotypic profile, of a subject.
There are many use cases for doing this task, for example: 

- Clinicians have to record a patient's phenotypic profile to facilitate more accurate diagnosis
- Researchers have to record phenotypic profiles of model organisms to characterise them and assess interventions (genetic or drug or otherwise).
- Curators extract knowledge from scientific publications to build knowledge bases which contain associations between phenotypes and other data types.

There are different schools and use cases that are concerned with how to record phenotypes in a structured manner:

- Quantified phenotypes can be recorded as a trait in combination with a measurement datum (“head circumference”, “35 cm”) or a qualified term expressing “phenotypic change” (“increased head circumference”).
- We can express phenotype terms as “pre-coordinated” terms, like “increased head circumference” or a “post-coordinated expression”, like “head”, “circumference”, “increased”).
- Phenotype data can be standardised to varying degrees, from free text to ontology terms.

In this lesson, we will introduce different concepts and categories around phenotype data, and provide an introduction on how to integrate them using the uPheno framework.
